I created this website as an application for me to be able to take the final exam for semester 2. The only submission requested is only the UI of the website with the condition that it used bootstrap and jquery. But in the process of making it, I created a backend process for the login and signup system.

I worked as a full stack developer on this project, as well as a UI/UX designer for that website.
